# Configuration overrides
#
# You can override anything you see in the "conf:" tree in box/box.yml here!
# Additionally, there are a few properties you can set here that do not have
# defaults in box.yml that you may find useful.
#
# APK REPOS
# Uncomment to use your favorite APK mirror
# Only add the URL pointing the mirror root, everything else is added automatically!
# For example, if you set the following:
#alpine_mirror: http://192.168.1.2/alpine
# it will resolve to:
# http://192.168.1.2/alpine/v3.3/{main,community}
# -AND-
# http://192.168.1.2/alpine/edge/{main,community,testing}
#
# UPSTREAM NTP SERVERS
# If you don't want to or can't use pool.ntp.org, you can set upstream NTP servers here.
# Note the syntax difference between "servers" for DNS round-robins and "server" for
# hosts that resolve to a single A record.
# upstream_1: servers 0.pool.ntp.org
# upstream_2: servers 1.pool.ntp.org weight 5
# upstream_1: server 1.my.private.server
# upstream_2: server 2.my.private.server weight 3
# upstream_3: server 3.my.private.server weight 6
# upstream_4: server 4.my.private.server weight 9
#
# TIME CONSTRAINT SOURCE
# OpenNTPD allows a form of time "fact-checking" by querying an HTTPS server
# to help constrain time drift in the event your time servers are all messed
# up or under MitM attack.
# Set this to an HTTPS server with reliable time. Google is the default.
# If you can't query Google, set this to something with reliable time that you can query.
